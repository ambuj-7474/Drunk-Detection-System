# Drunk-Detection-System
The Drunk Detection System (updated version of previous Sip-Step-AI-Drunk-People-Detection model) is a web-based application that uses machine learning to analyze video footage and detect signs of intoxication based on behavior patterns. It allows users to upload videos and receive a classification of whether the individual in the video appears drunk or sober. The system is designed for applications such as safety monitoring, law enforcement, or public health initiatives, providing an automated tool to detect intoxication through visual cues.

The system offers the following key features:

Video Upload: Users can upload MP4 videos (up to 50MB) for analysis via a user-friendly interface.
Classification: The system classifies the video as "Drunk" or "Sober" using a machine learning model, providing results with confidence scores.
Model Training: The system supports training on new data via the /train endpoint, allowing for customization with user-provided datasets.
Responsive Design: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern, responsive user interface accessible on various devices.

To set up and run the Drunk Detection System, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:-
Python 3.x for the backend.
Node.js and npm for the frontend.
Git for cloning the repository.

Run the Application:-

-> Start the backend: (The Flask server runs in debug mode on port 5000 by default.)

cd backend

python app.py

-> Start the frontend:

cd ../frontend

npm run dev

Usage
To use the system:

 -> Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
 
 -> Upload a video file (MP4 format, up to 50MB) via the interface.
 
 -> Wait for the system to process the video and display the classification result (e.g., "Drunk" or "Sober" with confidence).

To train the model with new data:

-> Place video files in 'drunk' and 'sober' directories within the backend folder.

-> Send a POST request to /train to trigger training, which will process the videos, extract features, and train the Random Forest Classifier.

This system helps identify intoxication from video footage, useful for safety or law enforcement. Itâ€™s built with modern web technologies and machine learning, making it accessible for users to upload and analyze videos.
